## Infrastructure

- **Branching and Merging**
    - For branching and merging in our team's repository, we will adopt the **GitHub Flow**, which is a simplified workflow based on the use of feature branches and pull requests. Here's how it works:
    - **Feature Branches:** When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, team members will create a dedicated feature branch from the main branch (usually named `main` or `master`). Each branch will have a clear and descriptive name, such as `feature/user-registration` or `bugfix/authentication-issue`.
    - **Development:** Developers will work independently on their feature branches, regularly committing their changes. Collaboration is encouraged, and developers can open discussions on GitHub if they need input or assistance from others.
    - **Pull Requests:** Once a feature or bug fix is complete, the developer will create a pull request (PR) to merge their branch into the main branch. The PR will include a detailed description of the changes made, screenshots if relevant, and any related issues
    - **Review and Testing:** Team members, including peers and designated reviewers, will review the PR. Automated tests will run to ensure that the code meets quality standards, and manual testing may be performed to verify new features or bug fixes.
    - **Merging:** After approval and successful testing, the PR is merged into the main branch. GitHub Flow encourages fast-paced development, as code is merged frequently.
- **Deployment Strategy**
    
    Our deployment strategy will be based on a Continuous Deployment (CD) approach, which automates the deployment process whenever changes are merged into the main branch. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are quickly and reliably pushed to production or staging environments.
    
- **Populating the App with Data**:
    
    To populate the app with data, we will use a combination of approaches:
    
    - **Seed Data**: We will create seed scripts to populate the database with initial data, such as sample stories, user profiles, and community guidelines. These scripts will be run during the application's setup process
    - **User-Generated Content:** The primary source of data will be user-generated content. As users create stories, illustrations, and engage with the platform, their contributions will populate the database.
    - **Content Discovery:** Implement features that encourage content creation, such as challenges, prompts, or writing contests, to stimulate user-generated content.
- **Testing**
    
    Testing is a critical aspect of our development process, and we will employ the following tools and practices:
    
    - **Unit Testing:** We will write unit tests for critical components and functions using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
    - **Integration Testing:** We will perform integration testing to ensure that different parts of the application work seamlessly together.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** E2E tests using tools like Cypress or Puppeteer will simulate user interactions and workflows to catch UI and functional issues
    - **Continuous Integration (CI):** We will set up CI pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Travis CI) to automate testing and ensure that new code is continuously validated
    - **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a manual testing step where team members review each other's code for quality, correctness, and adherence to coding standards.
    - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Before major releases, we may involve users in UAT to gather feedback and identify any usability or functional issues
        
        > By implementing these testing practices, we aim to maintain a high level of software quality, catch bugs early, and ensure a smooth user experience on our Community Storytelling and Art Platform.
        >
